To Compile Program
==================
Simply run `make` in the project root.
You can optionally set the RUN_TESTS macro to 1 and recompile in order to run our timing tests.

The program expects MSS_Problems.txt to be in the same directory as the executable. It will gracefully exit if this file is not found.

Program Output
